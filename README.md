# VENGE

VENGE (Vessel ENGinE) is a game engine written mainly in C++ that will eventually support Windows and Mac but currently supports only Linux. The ``main`` branch is currently the development brench but will eventually turn into the ``latest`` branch. No idea why I am writing this, because nobody else can see it as of right now. Anyway, moving on.

## Goals:

Currently, my/our goals for 2021 are not huge, but maybe a little ambitious for a single person to accomplish. My long term goals are definitely ambitious.

### By the end of the year, I am aiming for:

* One finished release (located in the ``latest`` branch)
* An internal API for core functions and connections
* An external API for input, events, and window events
  * 2D rendering system
* Support for OpenGL 3.1 and up
* Layer system


### And now my long-term goals:

* An Editor
  * Editor viewports and docking
  * Editor core (with a modular system for easier dev updates)
  * Extension/Plugin system
    * Extension API
  * Scene viewer
    * 2D/3D entity manipulation
    * Animation
  * Entity Tree
  * Project Tree
  * Run-in-editor option
* Support for Vulkan, DirectX 11/12, and Metal.
* Scripting
* I'm tired of listing things and will finish this later. Time to start developing!
